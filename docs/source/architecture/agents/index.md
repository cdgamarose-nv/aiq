# Agents

AI-Q uses a multi-agent architecture where an intent classifier routes queries to specialized research agents.

| Agent | Purpose | Speed | Depth |
|-------|---------|-------|-------|
| [Intent Classifier](./intent-classifier.md) | Route queries and determine research depth | Instant | — |
| [Clarifier](./clarifier.md) | Optionally gather missing context and the requested output type before deep research | Interactive | — |
| [Shallow Researcher](./shallow-researcher.md) | Fast, bounded research for simple questions | Fast (30-60s) | Surface |
| [Deep Researcher](./deep-researcher.md) | Advisory source routing, structured planning, concurrent evidence gathering, and writer synthesis | Several minutes; can exceed 10 | Deep |
| [Hybrid Researcher](./hybrid-researcher.md) | Coordinate conventional research with dependency-aware structured-data analysis | Thorough | Deep |
